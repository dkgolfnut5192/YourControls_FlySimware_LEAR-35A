# Known Issues:
   OCT 25, 2024 
   - HYDRAULIC PUMP SWITCH, HORN SILENCE SWITCH, SPOILER ON SWITCH will not sync
   - GPS/NAV SWITCH for selecting GPS track or VLOC doesn't sync, but will follow the person in commands config
   - ALTERNATE Altimeter 3 located middle front panel toward the top will not sync, but other primary Alt indicators work fine. 
   - For some reason all GPS indicator lights (GREEN) on Glareshield for AP ROLL, AFCS and PITCH do not show on Second plane when selected on PIC plane. You should manually synch these for who ever is not in command by selecting them to ensure config matches prior to swapping to the second pilot.
